# GettingCleaningData
Getting and Cleaning Data Project

This README file describes the process of the run_analysis.R file included in this repository

#Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Steps
1. Download the zip file and save it in the local folder for use
2. Run the run_anlaysis.R
3. The final table called TidyData.txt will be created in the local folder
